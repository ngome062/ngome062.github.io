        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Psychology has always been a huge passion of mine as my personal life planted a seed of interest which has blossomed throughout my academic career. My love of psychology first developed through learning different methods of both understanding and helping my family members who have mental disabilities. My father is diagnosed with Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder, and my younger brother was diagnosed with a higher level of Autism at the age of 2. Additionally, my mother suffers from a disability that renders her as legally blind, which led her to have distinct depressive episodes. Thus as the oldest sibling, I always felt that it was an obligation for me to learn how to effectively help my family members in the most efficient ways possible, whether it is helping my father calm down from bipolar episodes, or helping my brother comprehend how to recognize numbers or letters in ways that could apply best to him. Thus my family and upbringings were the true factors that sparked my interest in the complex field that is psychology.
 <br><br>

        Then after the COVID pandemic began to slowly fade, I was employed as a behavioral therapist for children with special needs. We worked with children that ranged from the ages of three to twenty one years old. Their ages correspond to the type of treatment plan they would receive, and it was my job to enforce that plan during in-home therapy sessions. We worked to modify existing behaviors, enforce positive behaviors, and teach patients new concepts. I would meet up with my designated case teams that were individualized for each patient, and we would coordinate behavioral methods for reinforcement or ethical punishment. These methods used behavioral psychology, such as reinforcing good behavior by giving the patients positive rewards, and when the child engaged in a negative behavior or refused to do their work in session, we would take away their preferred toy or would refuse to play when the child requested until the child positively changed their behavior. The treatment plans would then be modified as we analyzed the progress of each child patient after a certain time period. This job allowed me to engage in both behavioral and children psychology, which further cultivated my interest to continue to pursue the field. 
<br><br>

        Furthermore, apart from my personal and job experience, I also fully dedicate myself in school by taking rigorous psychology courses from many different backgrounds. I am taking many psychology courses of different varieties to both explore my passions as well as gain as vast of a range of psychology as possible as all studies of psychologies can overlap and the knowledge can be useful to me in my future career. I am still currently in the process of pursuing a B.A. in psychology, but am hoping to graduate soon as I am currently a senior. After graduation, I hope to use all of the knowledge I have learned to continue pursuing psychology but with more focus towards child developmental psychology or school psychology, which I will continue to pursue in graduate school later on down the road, and then work restlessly to become a psychologist that works closely with children.
